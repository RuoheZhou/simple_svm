# simple_svm

The package will be used on datasets such as Iris flower dataset to categorize data and find the
most suitable linear model based on the maximum distance between data points of both classes.
The output of the linear function and if that output is greater than 1, we identify it with one class
and if the output is -1, we identify is with another class. A model formed using only training
dataset can then be applied on testing dataset and the accuracy of the model prediction will be
generated. 

By imputing two features of a dataset in an array format into the package, it will generate a prediction and evaluate the accuracy of the prediction as well as a plot showing the categorization: <img width="585" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-11 at 8 10 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70445052/184513905-14c60f3c-04d4-48d2-a814-8ab3d446e746.png">
